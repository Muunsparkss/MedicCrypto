	Hi there ! This is a simple information encrypting and embedding application 
which is developed by two students Ahmed ABEIDEH and Mehmet Sedat YILDIZ from Istanbul Kultur University.

	We have developed this app using two libraries only:
--bitstring
--Pillow

The program uses XOR encryption to encrypt the information of the patients. The key is the doctor's id.

The embedding operation is simply changing the pixel RGB values in the given image.

THE INPUT IMAGE MUST BE 512*512 pixels.
THE OUTPUT IS ALWAYS A PNG FILE.

We hope this project helps you and inspires you. We had so much fun learning these libraries and implementing them.
